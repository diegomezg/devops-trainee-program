### Instructions

2. Make sure first line contains the ``shebang`` character followed by the absolute path to the bash executable binary
3. Write a comment within the script
4. Use the ``read`` built-in bash function

Display a menu to perform basic arithmetic operations as following:

```
Which operation would you like to do:

1. Addition
2. Substraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

```

Once an option is chosen, ask the user for 2 numbers to perform the arithmetic operation
appropriate, show the result in the shell  and return to the menu automatically to choose
another option until the user press 5 (exit).

**NOTE**: If the user press any other character(number or letter) out of the menu, show a prompt "Just choose from 1 to 5 please ..."
