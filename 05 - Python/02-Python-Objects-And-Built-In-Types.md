# Python 3
## Python objects (mutable/inmutable) and built-in types (tuples, lists, dictionaries)

### Objective
Understand the difference between an object and a variable in python, as well as some of the most common objects and start working with common Built-in types.

### Instructions
Create an MD file to explain and illustrate the following points:
- Explain an easy way to understand the difference between objects and variables (example in console is a must).
- Provide 1 example of, at least 6 different Built-in types in python.
- Show with an example how can you determine that an object is mutable and when an object it is not (console is a must).
- Apply and explain at least 3 different attributes of the 6 different Built-in types mentioned below.

### Expected deliverables
- MD file with each activity question answered
- An explanation for all the class using command line and images if needed
