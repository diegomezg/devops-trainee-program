 Python 3
# Seudo-Functional Python: Creation of list of comprehension and use of: Map, Reduce, Filter. And understand what a generator is and how to create one (yield)

### Objective
Be able to create a comprehension object in python and a generator. Also understand the difference between Map, reduce, filter an apply them to a real function.

### Instructions
Create a dummy repo or md file explaining and showing the follow:
- Based on a list of dictionaries create:
- A function with normal loops that iterate over the list of dictionaries and generate a tuple with all the values for keys: "name"
- Transform that normal function loops into a list of comprenhention.
- Transform that list of comprenhention into a generator and consume it.
- Based on this object: lista = ['elefante', 'rana', 'jirafa', 'perro', 'puerco', 'tigre']
- Create a function using lambda and filter that creates a list with all the strings that contains at least one "a"
- Create a function using map that creates a new list with the same string but adding " kun" at the end.
- Write an explanation of why reduce is not totally recommended in python 3.


### Expected deliverables
- MD file with each activity question answered
- explanation to all the class using command line and images if needed
