# Python 3+

## Goals
This course provides a general introduction to modern Python (3+) by grasping procedural, functional and object oriented concepts in one of the most beginner friendly programming language. 

At the end of the course the trainee will be able to read/write python modules of basic and intermediate complexity. 

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the most used python concepts
- Accelerate the reading and writing of python modules 
- Implement unit testing to ensure your code health 

## Contents
- Python Environment (Virtualenv)
- Python objects (Mutable Inmutable) and Built-in types (Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries)
- Seudo-Functional Python: Comprehesion lists with Map, Reduce, Filter, Yield 
- Classes, decorators and lambdas
- Handling Exceptions 
- Concurrent Python: Async, wait, popen 
- Standard Library overview (os, sys)  
- Unitesting 

## Learning Materials
- [Python standard library reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)
- [Python Package Index (PIP)](https://pypi.org/)
- [Python official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)
- [For the book lovers take a look to Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008)
