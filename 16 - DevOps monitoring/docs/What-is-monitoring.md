## What is Monitoring?

Monitoring is the activity of tracking how apps, servers and network behave in a business or company.

With Monitoring we can get data to analyze the performance of different items and objects than can be Hardward or Softward to be sure all goes as expected.

## Monitoring Basics

The essential elements to consider while monitoring an Application, a Server(local or cloud) or a Network are the Key Performance Indicators(KPIs), which will help us to track the performance of the different monitored items like the ICMP, Ports, Services, URL Availability, DNS Resolution, Page Loading Time and Logs. All this item will have their respective Key Performance Metrics(CPU usage, Memory usage, Load Average, Response Time, Apdex, etc), which will be the targets to set the corresponding threhsolds and Alerts.

## Importance of Monitoring

Once a software application goes to production, it's sure it has gone through different quality assurance verifications to comply with the agreements and requirements established by the app owners, so the next goal is to assure that this quality keeps high with good Yield and Availability(SLAs) and here is where Monitoring comes in action, the goal of Monitoring is to keep a tracking of the behavior of the apps, hosts and network of the business.

To achieve a good Yield and Availability it is important to set the adequate thresholds, so we can receive alerts from the different Monitoring tools that we use to prevent the happening of a bigger issues, it will always be better to prevent issues than trying to solving them.
