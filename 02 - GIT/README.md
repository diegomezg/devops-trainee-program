# Git

## Goals
This course will empower the trainee to perform intermediate git tasks and functionality while learning the fundamentals of git internals to allow them to collaborate in software projects.

It is pretty important that the trainee is not only able to do some 5 common git comands, but to understand the git flow, git branches, git purpose so he can not only work with git, also he will be able to implement git in new proyects.

## Objectives
- Able to create a good and understable MD document in any future git project.
- Employ and understand the main git commands such as: commit, pull, push, add, log, status, checkout in a software cycle process.
- Explain what a branch is and its usage in the operations/software industry.
- Solve git conflicts effectively.
- Discriminate the proper scenario to use git stash
- Relate the different areas in the git architecture model (working directory, staging area)
