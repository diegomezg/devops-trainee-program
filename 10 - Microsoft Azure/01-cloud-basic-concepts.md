# Microsoft Azure
# 01 - Cloud Basic Concepts

### Instructions
You will create **2 different mindmaps**, you can choose to do it by hand and take a picture, or use a digital tool like draw.io, lucidchart, miro and so on; each mindmap needs to synthesize, abstract, and overall display your own understanding of the concepts.
* Favor clear keywords over long definitions
* You may use images, icons, or symbols (optional)
* Challenge yourself to **not copy-paste**, but to understand and write what you understand about the concepts

### 1. What is cloud computing?

The first mind map will cover the content from the following page from the Azure fundamentals course:

- [Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/)
- [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/)
- [Azure architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/introduction)


Be sure to cover the following concepts:
*  Region
*  High Availability
*  Fault Tolerance
*  Disaster Recovery
*  Scalability 
*  Elasticity
---
* Why is cloud computing typically cheaper to use?
* Why should I move my infrastructure to the cloud?
* Cloud service models (iaas, paas, saas)
* Public, private and hybrid cloud models
* What is on-prem?

:warning:  The webpage from azure is a guide but be sure to also research in more sources the same information.

### 2. Cloud resources

Make another mindmap that covers the following topics:

* Cloud infrastructure definition
* Cloud architecture definition
* Cloud infrastructure components 
* Compare at least 5 cloud infrastructure components between 3 different cloud providers

You can use the following resources or research others that you find convenient:
* https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-infrastructure
* https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-cloud-architecture

### Expected deliverables
- MD file including a picture of each mindmap
- Additional references included
