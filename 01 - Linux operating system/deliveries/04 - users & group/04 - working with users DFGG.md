## Describe the different methods to consult groups in Linux
```sh
less /etc/group
```
To view all groups present on the system
```sh
getent group
```
Getent command which displays entries from databases configured in _/etc/nsswitch.conf_ file including the group database which we can use to query a list of all groups
```sh
groups <username>
```
The groups commands is used to get a list of groups a specific user is in
## How can you delete groups in Linux?
To delete (remove) a given group from the system, invoke the groupdel command followed by the group name.
```sh
groupdel dou-devops
```
The command above removes the group entry from the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files.  
On success, the groupdel command does not print any output.
You can verify that the group is removed, by listing all groups using the following command:
```sh
getent group | grep dou-devops
```
If the group you want to remove doesnâ€™t exist, the system will print an error message like the following:
```sh
groupdel: group 'dou-devops' does not exist
```
## Tell us the different method to use root privileges
### Changing from user to superuser
1. sudo _command_  
Only execute the command and continue as a common user
2. sudo -i  
Needs login password, change shell to /root/home directory
3. su  
Needs root password
4. sudo -s  
Gives root access but keeps current shell
