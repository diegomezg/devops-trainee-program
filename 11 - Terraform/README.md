## TERRAFORM 


**Course duration – 3 days **

##### Goals of the course

Trainees will be led to make complete infrastructure as code on different providers (AWS & Kubernetes). From a series of Terraform configurations, they will learn to manage the entire infrastructure life cycle, to create, modify and eliminate it. Most common architectures and best practices.  

##### Learning objectives 

- Understanding immutable infrastructure. 
- Understand when to use Terraform and/or Config Mgmt tools. 
- Use DevOps techniques with Terraform. 
- Learn to integrate Terraform to CICD tools.
