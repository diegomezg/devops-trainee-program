# TERRAFORM 

###### Course duration – 3 days

## Goals of the course

Trainees will be led to make complete infrastructure as code on different providers (AWS & Kubernetes). From a series of Terraform configurations, they will learn to manage the entire infrastructure life cycle, to create, modify and eliminate it. Most common architectures and best practices.  

## Learning objectives 

- Recognize immutable infrastructure. 
- Identify when to use Terraform and/or configuration management tools. 
- Use DevOps techniques with Terraform. 
- Integrate Terraform to CICD tools.
