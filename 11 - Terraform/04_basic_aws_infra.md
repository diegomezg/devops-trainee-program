## 04 â€“ Basic AWS Infrastructure

Trainees will create and tie AWS resources: VPC, Security Group and Instance. You'll need to create a new git project called basic_aws_infra.

##### Instructions

1. Create file `main.tf` and include the following resources:
    - Provider
    - aws_security_group
    - aws_key_pair
    - aws_ami
    - aws_instance


2. In the same file include a public VPC with the following resources:
    - aws_vpc
    - aws_subnet
    - aws_route_table
    - aws_internet_gateway
    - aws_route_table_association
    - aws_route

# Modules
* After you created the resources and confirmed that everything is working fine in AWS, we are going to proceed moduling these resources. Proceed with the following:

3. Inside your main project directory, create `modules` directory. Inside `modules`, create directories:
    - ami
    - security
    - securitygroup
    - vpc


4. Move resources in the directories as the following:
    - `aws_ami` resource in `ami` directory
    - `aws_key_pair` in `security`
    - `aws_security_group` in `securitygroup`
    - `aws_vpc`, `aws_subnet`, `aws_route_table`, `aws_internet_gateway`, `aws_route_table_association` and `aws_route` in `vpc`
    - Keep the `Provider` and `aws_instance` in `main.tf` file


5. In main.tf call the modules and then insert the required values in the aws_instance. To call these values you'll need to use the outputs inside each modules directory

* Configure the resources using the following diagram: https://gitlab.com/dou-university/planning-committee/grad-program/-/blob/terraform/11%20-%20Terraform/04_basic_aws_infra_diagram.pdf

##### Expected deliverables 

You have to be able to reach the server in port 22 using the public IP assigned to the instance after launch
