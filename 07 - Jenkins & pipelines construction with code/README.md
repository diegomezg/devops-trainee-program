# Jenkins & Pipelines Construction with Code

## Goals
Trainee will learn the structure of Declarative Pipeline, how to control the flow of execution, how to save artifacts of the build, and get practice using some of the features that give fit and finish to your Pipeline.

## Objectives
- Explain CI/CD concepts. 
- Build pipelines.
- Relate to the fundamentals of Jenkins and its setup. 
- Manipulate Jenkins GUI. 
- Configure and build basic Tools/Plugins. 
- Use Jenkins to set up Build Pipelines. 
- Integrate builds tools such as Gradle, GitHub, Maven and Tomcat. 
- Identify the differences between scripted and declarative pipelines. 
- Interpret the structure of a declarative pipeline, including the role of the stage, step, agent, and post sections
- The use of Groovy language to construct a pipeline.
