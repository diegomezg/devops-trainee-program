# Microservices Architecture

## Goals
The goal of the course is for trainees to understand what is a microservices architecture, how it compares with other types of architectures and get a basic understanding of how it would look like to migrate from a monolithinc architecture to microservices   

## Objectives
- Explain what a microservice is      
- Describe a microservices architecture and its main advantages/disadvantages     
- Explain what a 12 factor app is     
- Build a monolithic web application     
- Describe each part and understand the communication between each component
- Migrate the monolithic app to a microservices design using docker and docker compose
- Understand what horizontal scaling is, and understand what it need to work properly
